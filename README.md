# About

I built this app in 3 days. 

* First, it prompts the user to log in via Gmail.
* Once the user is logged in, it asks the user to rate a fictional meeting they 
had with "Bob."
* If they rate their meeting with a 4 or 5-star rating, the app provides them a 
link to invite a friend to the app.
* Users who open the invite link can sign up to join the "Concierge" service.

The app tracks unique invites and signups by using cookies. It also features an 
[analytics page](https://young-refuge-6353.herokuapp.com/analytics/), which 
displays the conversion rate from invites to signups.

# To-Do

Generalize this app to an API, so that companies and developers can easily track 
unique conversion rates on any feature or web page.
